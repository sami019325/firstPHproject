            <h3>Bio</h3>
            <p>It's me Aajamn Sami who enjoys coding because it is full of power, a power that can be used to control
                the
                internet. I chose web development because I think the internet has a huge power to reach people within a
                second and it can be done by learning web development. I also love other programming languages as well
                and I
                will learn some of these in future but for now, javascript is okay. However, if you are reading this,
                thank
                you.</p>
